Good day, my name is Erik, and I am currently serving as a Signal Operator in the Canadian Armed Forces, looking to transition into a cybersecurity analyst role. Over the past seven years, I have honed my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail while navigating complex and high-pressure scenarios during deployments and training exercises. These skills have been instrumental in my studies as I work toward a career in cybersecurity.

My passion for cybersecurity began years ago when I first installed BackTrack 5 Linux on my old laptop. Though my military career initially took me in a different direction, that early interest never faded. Now, through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program, I am actively developing my technical skills and deepening my understanding of the field.

I believe my diverse experience in both military and civilian environments equips me with a unique perspective on security challenges. My discipline, adaptability, and commitment to ethical standards will enable me to contribute meaningfully to organizations and clients with critical security needs. I am eager to apply my knowledge and experience to protect systems, data, and people in an increasingly digital world.
